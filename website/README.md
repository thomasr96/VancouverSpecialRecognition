# VancouverSpecialRecognition

This project holds code for a Java Spring Boot and React web app. The finished product will display data of Vancouver Specials in Burnaby, British Columbia and perform image recognition for the house style. Inspired by vancouverspecial.com, this app uses deep learning methods to detect house styles in Google Streetview. 

To see the interesting story behind the rise and fall in popularity of the Vancouver Special, see https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0086386.
